# About This Site
      
This site aims to provide some basic insights of COVID-19 from the point of view of data analysis. 

I don't have a medical background, yet I do have some experience of data analysis and education. I know sometimes it's not about how much one has spoken, it's more about how much information has been conveyed.

While many other sites provide much much more comprehensive information of COVID19, this site aims to convey the <strong>most plain and basic</strong> ideas.

All data are directly collected from Government websites, please <a href='https://github.com/covid19facts/covid19facts.github.io/issues'>raise an issue</a> if you believe some of the data source is inappropriate.
