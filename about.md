# About This Page
      
I happened to have some background of programming, analytics and education, so I thought a little page like this might help others in future.

All data are directly collected from government websites, please <a href='https://github.com/covid19facts/covid19facts.github.io/issues'>create an issue</a> if you believe some of the data are incorrect.
