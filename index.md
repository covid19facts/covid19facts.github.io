# Q: Is COVID-19 just a bad flu?

Here we inspect the question based on the <strong>overall death toll</strong> of United States. Generally speaking, the confirmation of death is quite straight forward. The numbers below include the deaths of all causes, i.e. heart attack, cancer, influenza, car accidents, etc.


||2016| 2017 | 2018 | 2019 | 2020 |
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|Death Toll|2,744,248|2,813,503|2,839,205|2,854,838|<strong>3,358,814</strong>|

Even when the numbers are big and y-axis begins from zero, one could easily notice the obvious uprise in 2020.

Based on the statistics alone, we may conclude that <strong>something deadly must have happened in 2020</strong>.

<strong>Unless there are some hideous huge disasters that happened in 2020</strong>, which is overlooked by every one in the country, COVID19 related deaths would best match this number abnormality so far.

<br/>
## How About Flu

CDC reports also provided detailed information of death cases by flu. Here are the <strong>death cases per 100,000 standard population</strong>, of each year for all causes vs influenza. 



||2016| 2017 | 2018 | 2019 | 2020 |
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|Deaths per 100,000|728.8|731.9|723.6|715.2|<strong>828.7</strong>|
|Deaths due to influenza and pneumonia per 100,000|13.5|14.3|14.9|12.3||

Flu data of 2020 is not yet available. Yet, we could still see that, <strong>the flu related cases will hardly impact the total death toll in a significant way</strong>.
